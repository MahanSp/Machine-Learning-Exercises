# Machine-Learning-Exercises

This repository contains a series of interactive Jupyter Notebooks that document my journey through learning and applying fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each notebook focuses on a different concept or technique, enabling hands-on practice, insight exploration, and iterative improvement.

##  Notebooks Overview

| Notebook Name                                | Focus                          | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `Mini Project 1 (Visualization).ipynb`       | Data visualization             | Introduction to exploratory data analysis and plotting.
| `Mini Project 2 â€“ regression exercise.ipynb`  | Regression modeling            | Hands-on work with linear or polynomial regression methods.
| `Mini Project 3.ipynb`                        | Supervised learning            | Implementation of classification/regression algorithms.
| `Mini Project 4.ipynb`                        | Unsupervised learning          | Exploring clustering, dimensionality reduction, or other unsupervised techniques.
| `Project1.ipynb`                              | Capstone-style project         | A more comprehensive application combining multiple ML techniques.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Core libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and optionally `seaborn`.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
