# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises I completed while learning the fundamentals of machine learning.  
The goal of this repo is not to present polished projects, but to document my practice and progress as I worked through different concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving approaches.

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

The notebooks are structured as step-by-step exercises covering core ML topics:

- **Data Exploration & Visualization** â€“ practicing with `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn` to understand datasets.
- **Regression Models** â€“ linear and polynomial regression, training and evaluating models, working with error metrics.
- **Classification** â€“ experimenting with algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, or logistic regression.
- **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ clustering (e.g., k-means) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
- **Mini Projects** â€“ small, guided exercises that apply multiple concepts together.
- **Larger Exercises** â€“ more open-ended notebooks where I combined several techniques into end-to-end workflows.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements
Youâ€™ll need Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.  
Core libraries used include:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
